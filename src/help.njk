            Hopefully the scoreboard is pretty intuitive to use, but here's a little
            guidance just in case!

                <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white">Basic Gameplay</strong>
                By default, you are configured for a five-game match, played to 11
                points, and you are required to win by two. Just <strong class="font-bold text-white">click the button for
                whichever player scored</strong> until one player wins. This will bring up
                the <strong class="font-bold text-white">win screen</strong>; just click the button
                to start the next game. Once one player wins three games, the match will end and you can
                start a new match. The game and match end screens will change the
                <span class="px-1 text-white bg-green-700 rounded">background to green</span> and display a message about the winner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white">Keybinds</strong>
                If you don't have the luxury of a separate scorer, each player
                has a unique keybind that works just like the scoring buttons.
                You can use a <strong class="font-bold text-white">wireless keyboard or presentation clicker</strong>
                for much faster scoring.
                I built this so I could keep a wireless presentation clicker in my
                pocket and keep score on my iPad on a nearby table. By default, it uses
                the <em class="italic text-white">Left and Right Arrow Keys</em> for scoring and
                <em class="italic text-white">Tab</em> for making corrections. More on that below
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white">Corrections</strong>
                    In case you click the wrong button or push the wrong key, there is a quick
                    way to make scoring corrections. Simply press the
                    <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase">Correction</strong> button or
                    bound key to enter correction mode. <em class="italic text-white">Now the scoring buttons/keys will subtract
                    a point instead of adding a point</em>. Then simply click the correction
                    button/key to go back to normal game mode. Try not to mess up the final
                    point since the game ends instantly. You can tell you're in setup mode
                    because it will change the
                    <span class="px-1 text-white bg-red-700 rounded">background to red.</span>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Customization</h2>
                <p>
                    You can change a variety of settings about the scoreboard in game by
                    clicking the <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase">Setup</strong> button
                    at the bottom. Setup mode has a
                    <span class="px-1 text-black bg-yellow-500 rounded">yellow background.</span>
                    Anything you set will be saved to your browser for the next time you use
                    the scoreboard. You can click the <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase">Reset</strong>
                    button to go back to the defaults. Click the <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase">Done</strong>
                    button to go back to
                    <span class="px-1 text-white bg-blue-700 rounded">game mode.</span> Your
                    settings will save automatically.
                    <p>
                        <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white">Player Names</strong>
                        You can change the names displayed for each player. Just type the new
                        names into the boxes on the setup page.
                    </p>

                        <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white">Changing Keybinds</strong>
                        The keybinds are set to what I think are reasonable defaults based on my
                        setup, but yours may be different. Click the
                        <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase">Record Key</strong>
                        button under the keybind that you want to change, then press the key you
                        want to bind. It should show up in the box above, showing that the key
                        was successfully bound.
                    </p>

                        <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white">Game/Match Settings</strong>
                        Below the keybinding section, you can also change the
                        <strong class="font-bold text-white">number of points</strong> required
                        to win a game and the <strong class="font-bold text-white">number
                        of games</strong> in a match. Note that this is the maximum number of
                        games, not the number of games required to win. If you set it to five,
                        then one player must win three games. This number cannot be even as
                        that would allow a tie.
